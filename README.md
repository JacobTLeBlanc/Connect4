# Connect4
A playable version of Connect 4 in the Java console

- This was created as I was learning Object Oriented Programing and Inheritance
- I tried giving the bot some "Artificial Intelligence" by increasing the probability of placing a "piece" next to one he's already placed

Run testConnectFour to play Connect Four
